The deployment script checks for the existance of a "scope.txt" file in every folder.If such file exists, the ID or Name given in the file will be used as the scope for the deployment(s). If such a file does not exist, the foldername where the template resides will be used as the scopes name.
Make sure you only use the scopes as they are defined here at the top level (i.e. don't put Resource Groups as scopes under SubscriptionLevelDeployments folder.
